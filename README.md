## Chapter 1 - Functional programming

What makes it functional? [Every function is a value](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/unified-types.html) with support for anonymous functions, higher-order functions, allows [functions to be nested](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/nested-functions.html), and supports currying. Functions are first-class values in Scala. There are case classes and built-in support for pattern matching model algebraic types. Singleton objects project a convenient way to group functions that aren't members of a class.

[Anonymous functions](https://dzone.com/articles/scala-higher-order-and-anonymous-functions) - using a function where it's declared as opposed to declaring it somewhere else first

[Higher-order functions](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/higher-order-functions.html) - take other functions as parameters or return a function.  `map` is a common example. Functions passed as arguments are `callback functions`.

[Currying](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/multiple-parameter-lists.html) - when a method is called with a fewer number of parameter lists than it defined, yielding a function taking the missing parameter lists as its arguments

[Case classes](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/case-classes.html) - like regular classes that have an apply method by default that takes care of object construction, and are compared by structure, not reference. They are good for modeling immutable data. They are declared with the `case class` keywork, new is not used, and parameter(s) are passed.

[Pattern matching](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/pattern-matching.html) - a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. A match can deconstruct the value into parts. More powerful than `switch` and can be used in place of if/else's.

Scala is also object-oriented. [Every value is an object](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/unified-types.html) (i.e. functions represented by objects are called function values). Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits. Classes are extended by subclassing & a mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.

[Traits](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/traits.html) - for sharing interfaces and fields betweemn classes (like Java 8 interfaces). Can be extended by classes and objects but cannot be instantiated so have no parameters.

[Mixin-based compoition](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/mixin-class-composition.html) - traits used to compose a class

### Section 1.1 - Why functional programming?

Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits. Classes are extended by subclassing and a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.

### Section 1.2 - Getting started

### Section 1.3 - Data Structures

### Section 1.4 - Exceptions without Errors

### Section 1.5 - Handling state

## Chapter 2 - Scala

### Section 2. 1 - Intro

### Section 2. 2 - Using collections

Sequence comprehensions - syntatic construct for creating a list based on existing lists. `For comprehensions` can enumerate and filter.

### Section 2. 3 - Pattern matching

For those not familiar with pattern matching, think of it as an eloquent, more advanced/useful switch statement. Pattern matching can be used to match more than just primitives. Pattern matching can match on custom types and can even extract from tuples or case classes. In a basic example below, we created the case class "Player", which consists of two fields: a number, and the player name. We created an instance of that class and matched on cases where the player's number is 20 and print the name.

```
case class Player(Number: Int, Name: String)
val runningback = Player(20, "Barry Sanders")
runningback match {
  case Player(20, name) =>
    println(name + " is number 20!")
}
```


Pattern matching can also be a valuable tool when combined with for comprehensions. Below, we created a tuple of two integers, match on it, and yield the sum.


```
val x = (32, 15)

val (a,b) = x

for((a,b) <- Some(x)) yield a+b // The result would be Some(47)
```

This is a basic introduction of Pattern Matching in Scala. For more information, check out the official scala-lang documentation below.

### Section 2. 4 - Composing functions

### Section 2. 5 - Polymorphism and types

### Section 2.6  - Type Classes

Type Classes are  constructs that allow us to add ad-hoc polymorphism. Type Classes are not a native construct and are not obviously recongnizable but you might have worked with them.

A Type Class is a group of classes that satisfy a contract provided by a trait. Type Classes allow us to add functionality to an existing class without modifying it. Type Classes in scala are composed of three parts
* The type class
* The instances for the various types
* The interface methods that are exposed to the outside world

Consider an ADT that represents JSON structures.



```scala
scala> sealed trait Json
defined trait Json

scala> final case class JsObject(get: Map[String, Json]) extends Json
defined class JsObject

scala> final case class JsString(get: String) extends Json
defined class JsString

scala> final case class JsNumber(get: Double) extends Json
defined class JsNumber

scala> case object JsNull extends Json
defined object JsNull
```
```//Type Class```
```scala
scala> trait JsonWriter[A] {
     |   def write(value: A): Json
     | }
defined trait JsonWriter
```

The type class instances provide implementations for the types we want to add functionality to. Say we want to be able to serialize a case class representing a person.

```//the instance```
```scala
scala> final case class Person(name: String, address: String)
defined class Person

scala> object JsonWriterInstances {
     |   implicit val stringWriter: JsonWriter[String] = new JsonWriter[String] {
     |     def write(value: String): Json = JsString(value)
     |   }
     | 
     |   implicit val personWriter: JsonWriter[Person] = new JsonWriter[Person] {
     |     def write(value: Person): Json =
     |       JsObject(Map("name" -> JsString(value.name), "address" -> JsString(value.address)))
     |   }
     | }
defined object JsonWriterInstances
```
```//Finally the interface methods```
```scala
scala> object JsonInterface {
     | 	 implicit class JsonWriterOps[A](value: A) {
     |       def toJson(implicit w: JsonWriter[A]): Json = w.write(value)
     |     }
     |   }
defined object JsonInterface
```

```//Putting it all together```
```scala
scala> import JsonWriterInstances._
import JsonWriterInstances._

scala> import JsonInterface._
import JsonInterface._

scala> Person("Homer", "742 Evergreen Terrace").toJson
res0: Json = JsObject(Map(name -> JsString(Homer), address -> JsString(742 Evergreen Terrace)))
```

### Section 2. 6 - Concurrency

#### Futures and Promises

##### Futures 

A future is a placeholder object for a value that may not exist yet becuase of an async operation that hasn't yet completed. Callbacks populate the future with the actual value when it's ready. The execution to get said value happens in an `ExecutionContext` - similar to an `Executor`, it can execute computations in a new, pooled or the current (discouraged) thread. Futures are completed when they get the value back from the computation, whether that's the expected value or an exception thrown from it, and that result is immuatable. They can also hold an exception which is the other possiblity from the executing computation. They are generally for async operations but can block when necessary.

`Future[T]` is a type which denotes future objects, whereas `Future.apply` is a method which creates and schedules an asynchronous computation, and then returns a future object which will be completed with the result of that computation.

EXAMPLE: Letâ€™s assume that we want to use a hypothetical API of some popular stock service to get stock quotes and buy if a good deal. We will open a new connection and send a request to obtain a list:

It is mde async with a future, and the following lines handle the results:

```scala
import scala.concurrent._
import ExecutionContext.Implicits.global

val connection = ...

val rateQuote = Future {
  connection.getCurrentValue(USD)
}

rateQuote onSuccess { case quote =>
  val purchase = Future {
    if (isProfitable(quote)) connection.buy(amount, quote)
    else throw new Exception("not profitable")
  }

  purchase onSuccess {
    case _ => println("Purchased " + amount + " USD")
  }
  case Failure(t) => println("An error has occured: " + t.getMessage)
}
```

Importing `scala.concurrent` brings in `Future` and the 2nd import brings in the default execution context.

###### Mapping 

The problems with this approach are nested callbacks are required when doing a subsequent action in the onComplete of the first, and that operation & result is limited within that scope. For these reasons, futures provide combinators such as `map`, which allow a more straightforward composition. `map` will produce a new future with the value mapped from the original when it's completed (not dissimilar to mapping collections).

The above can be done using `map` to eliminate the nesting and one onSuccess callback:

```scala
val rateQuote = Future {
  connection.getCurrentValue(USD)
}

val purchase = rateQuote map { quote =>
  if (isProfitable(quote)) connection.buy(amount, quote)
  else throw new Exception("not profitable")
}

purchase onSuccess {
  case _ => println("Purchased " + amount + " USD")
}
```

###### Combinators 

If the mapping function throws an exception the future is completed with that exception. If the original future fails with an exception then the returned future also contains the same exception. This exception propagating semantics is present in the rest of the combinators, as well. They are designed to work with `for-comprehensions` also, so futures contain `flatMap`, `filter` and `foreach` combinators. 

`flatMap` is not typically used outside of `for-comprehensions`, and `filter` creates a new future with the original's value only if it satisfies some predicate, else failing with a `NoSuchElementException`.

###### Exception combinators

Combinators to handle future exceptions include `recover`, which maps the exception to a new future's value. `recoverWith` is available and is similar to how `map` relates to `flatMap`. `fallbackTo` will try to populate a new future with the value of a fallback function given the first threw an exception. For example:

```scala
val usdQuote = Future {
  connection.getCurrentValue(USD)
} map {
  usd => "Value: " + usd + "$"
}
val chfQuote = Future {
  connection.getCurrentValue(CHF)
} map {
  chf => "Value: " + chf + "CHF"
}

val anyQuote = usdQuote fallbackTo chfQuote

anyQuote onSuccess { println(_) }
```

`andThen` can be used just for side effect purposes, and can be chained and executed in order, essentially creating a new future as a copy of the original.

Projections can be used to enable for-comprehensions on a result returned as an exception.

Combinators are purely functional - they each return a new future which is related to the one it was derived form.

###### Promises

A promise is similar to a future but is writable (CompletableFuture), so can be kept by the issuer explicitly as it has a public setter.

### Section 2. 7 - Testing: Scalatest and Specs

### Section 2. 8 - Using SBT

#### What is SBT?

    Simple Build Tool is a modernized build tool. It is a general purpose build tool that can be used for building any JVM project, but it is written in scala and it has features built out specifically for scala use.
    
##### quick terminology 

    - everything in sbt is either a task or a setting. tasks are things scala does, settings are values you are defining. tasks are scala functions and sbt builds a dependency graph to determine how to execute them.
    
#### How do I use it?

##### Bootstrap a new project (this is recommended standard for scala projects using sbt)
sbt new scala/scala-seed.g8 (creates new scala project from minimal scala template https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.0/docs/sbt-new-and-Templates.html)

this will create a standard directory structure for a minimal scala project, with 
```
build.sbt
src/main/scala/example
src/test/scala/example
project/Dependencies.scala
project/build.properties
```
your build.sbt in here already has scalatest added as a managed dependency.

##### Jump into the sbt shell

- inside of an existing sbt project directory you use _sbt_ or _sbt console_ command and it will load up the sbt shell in interactive mode. This is like a scala REPL but you have access to all project source files and dependencies, you can import them.

##### Use it as a build console (here are common commands ripped mostly from twitter scala school

Common Commands
* run - 
* actions â€“ show actions available for this project
* update â€“ downloads dependencies
* compile â€“ compiles source
* test â€“ runs tests
* package â€“ creates a publishable jar file
* publish-local â€“ installs the built jar in your local ivy cache
* publish â€“ pushes your jar to a remote repo (if configured)
Moar Commands
* test-failed â€“ run any specs that failed
* test-quick â€“ run any specs that failed and/or had dependencies updated
* clean-cache â€“ remove all sorts of sbt cached stuff. Like clean for sbt
* clean-lib â€“ remove everything in lib_managed

##### Dependency Management

- A nice thing about build.sbt is that it is just more scala, so your build configuration is just more of the language you are likely coding in.
- Every entry in build.sbt boils down to a key value pair where the key is defined in Scala.Keys
- SBT supports managed and unmanaged dependencies.

##### Managed Dependencies
(some portions of this taken directly from https://alvinalexander.com/scala/sbt-how-to-manage-project-dependencies-in-scala)

* managed dependencies are dependencies that sbt helps you pull from either the default Maven2 repo or another repo that you have set up a resolver for (more on that later).

* most larger dependencies you pull in you are going to want to treat as managed dependencies, because they will likely have libraries they in turn depend on, which have libraries that they depend on... (transitive dependencies). sbt with the help of ivy sorts all that out for you. 

*adding to your build.sbt* 
the template for adding a managed dependency is:

```
libraryDependencies += groupID % artifactID % revision % configuration
```
* configuration is optional, allows you to profile which dependencies you want to bring in depending on how you are running your scala code.

* SBT defines a minimal DSL for declaring dependencies which is being used in the above template: 

```
+= Appends to the keyâ€™s value. The build.sbt file works with settings defined as key/value pairs. In the examples shown, libraryDependencies is a key, and itâ€™s shown with several different values.
% A method used to construct an Ivy Module ID from the strings you supply.
%% When used after the groupID, it automatically adds your projectâ€™s Scala version (such as _2.10) to the end of the artifact name.
```

* If you haven't used ivy before, you can check where it is keeping your managed dependencies by looking at 

##### Unmanaged Dependencies
--leaving this to be fleshed out later, cool but we probably won't use them much--

#### Cool Things

    * triggered actions, when you preface a scala task with a tilde e.g. sbt run ~test, it will watch your project source files and perform that action when there is a change, so you can get a quick feedback loop as you develop.
    * sbt uses a lazy dependency management system, sbt doesn't tell ivy to go get dependencies if the configuration hasn't changed unless you force it to with sbt update, https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/Dependency-Management-Flow.html 
    * the dependency graph that sbt uses for tasks means that sbt determines which tasks it can run in parallel and which need to be run sequentially, optimizing for a very fast task execution

   https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/02-sbt/README.md - sbt missing manual, good overview of how to think about sbt and what sbt is doing. 
   https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/sbt.html - the twitter scala code school sbt page. this section pulled a lot from twitter's page, it has an easy to follow tutorial that will get you performing most of the main functions of sbt fast.
   https://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Basic-Def-Examples.html - a set of helpful build.sbt recipes to tweak configuaration settings.
   
#### Other thigns that we could add to SBT seciton
- adding resolvers for other repositories
- multi project builds
