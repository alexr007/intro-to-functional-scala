## Key Concepts 

Key Concepts:

- Functions & Evaluation
  - Functional vs. imperative
  - expressions, evaluation, conditionals, functional loops, functions, tuples, tail recursion
- Higher Order Functions
  - functions as first class values, 
  - Scala syntax and how it's formally defined
  - methods, classes, data abstraction thru design of data structures
- Data abstraction
  - traits
  - classes in hierarchies; hierarchy of standard Scala types; polymorphism
  - organize classes and traits into packages
- Types and Pattern Matching
  - functions vs objects (functions are objects)
  - Scala type system details - generics, subtyping, variance, etc.
  - Lists data structure
  - Pattern matching
- Abstractions for concurrency (i.e. futures, semaphores, actors)
